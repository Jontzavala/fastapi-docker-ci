# Docker CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline using Docker and GitHub Actions.
Whenever code is pushed to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Builds a Docker image using the project's Dockerfile
3. Tags the image with the correct Docker Hub repository name
4. Authenticates to Docker Hub using GitHub Secrets
5. Pushes the image to Docker Hub

This setup follows standard DevOps practices for container-based CI/CD pipelines.

## What This Project Does

- Builds a Docker image from application source code
- Uses GitHub Actions to automate Docker builds
- Tags the image with a Docker Hub repository name
- Pushes the image to Docker Hub
- Ensures consistent, reproducible images using CI/CD
- Demonstrates real-world DevOps workflow design

---

## How It Works

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow file located in .github/workflows/docker-ci.yml:

- Checks out the repository
- Logs into Docker Hub using secrets
- Builds the Docker image
- Tags the image according to your Docker Hub repository
- Pushes the image to Docker Hub

This process happens automatically on pushes to the main branch or manually when triggered.

---

### 2. Docker Hub Integration

The workflow authenticates to Docker Hub using two GitHub Secrets:

DOCKER_USERNAME  
DOCKER_PASSWORD

DOCKER_PASSWORD should be a Docker Hub access token created in Docker Hub → Account Settings → Security.

Secrets ensure your credentials never appear in logs or code.

---

### 3. Docker Image Tagging

The workflow tags the Docker image using your Docker Hub repository name, for example:

yourusername/yourimage:latest

This tag tells Docker Hub where to store the image.

Additional tags like version numbers or commit SHAs can also be added for rollback support.

---

## GitHub Secrets Required

Add these secrets in:

GitHub → Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

DOCKER_USERNAME  
Your Docker Hub username.

DOCKER_PASSWORD  
A Docker Hub access token (recommended over using your password).

---

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow runs automatically when:

- Code is pushed to the main branch

It can also be triggered manually using “Run Workflow” inside GitHub Actions.

This supports both automated CI and manual builds.

---

## Running the Workflow Manually

Navigate to:

GitHub → Actions → Select workflow → Run workflow

You may want to trigger the workflow manually when:

- Testing the pipeline
- Rebuilding after changing secrets
- Deploying without making new commits

---

## Repository Structure

project/
Dockerfile  
 app/ (your application code)  
 .github/workflows/docker-ci.yml

---

## Summary

This repository contains a complete CI/CD pipeline that:

- Builds Docker images automatically
- Uses GitHub Actions as the automation engine
- Pushes images to Docker Hub securely
- Ensures consistent and reproducible builds
- Demonstrates essential DevOps and cloud engineering skills

This setup is suitable for portfolio use, interviews, and real-world containerized application deployments.
